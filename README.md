# Assignment 8: Mission Demolition

## Overview

**Mission Demolition-** This is my version of Mission Demolition which is a physics-based game inspired by classics like Angry Birds. The main gameplay involves the player using a slingshot to shoot projectiles at various castles, aiming to hit a specific goal area (in green) to pass a level. It's written in C# in UNITY.

## Tips

My recommendation would be to try to knck down the blocks and expose the goal area and then freeshoot it using the least amount of projectiles possible. I actually had fun playing this for a few hours after I tested it
